               FADE IN:

               EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY

               A mountain peak dominates the landscape.

               TITLES BEGIN

               Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance 
               they appear to be a company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.

               CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS

               Reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The 
               riders are silhouetted against the rising sun as they ride 
               into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.

               The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.

                                     OFFICER
                         Dis-mount!

               RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we 
               realize that this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about 
               thirteen years of age. The "Commanding Officer" is only their 
               SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.

               One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from 
               his horse, bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on 
               him.

                                     FIRST SCOUT
                         Herman's horsesick!

               A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of 
               straw-colored hair and the no-nonsense expression common to 
               kids whose curiosity and appetite for knowledge exceed what 
               they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his uniform 
               with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.

                                     SCOUTMASTER
                         Chaps, don't anybody wander off. 
                         Some of the passageways in here can 
                         run for miles.

               Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.

               INT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the 
               temperature drops several degrees. Spiders have built huge 
               webs that get caught in the boys' hair.

               Herman appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this 
               enterprise, but he's drawn on by his companion's adventurous 
               curiosity.

                                     HERMAN
                         I don't think this is such a good 
                         idea.

               LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward 
               its source.

               The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their 
               source. The light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel 
               walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay 
               hidden.

                                     HERMAN
                         What is it?

               This is what they see:

               FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken 
               into one of the pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."

               The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE 
               (a Bowery Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black 
               hair that cascades over his shoulders).

               And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN 
               FELT FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would 
               be willing to bet anything that this is INDIANA JONES.

               However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by 
               the lantern's glow, we are shocked to discover that it is 
               someone else.

               We'll call him FEDORA.

               TITLES END

               The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.

               Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA 
               JONES.

                                     FEDORA
                         Alfred, did you get anything yet?

                                     MAN
                         Nothing. Dig in.

               Two of the men stand and look at Roscoe who steps forward 
               holding a box in his hands.

                                     ROSCOE
                         Hey, I've got something!

               Whoops from the other men.

                                     ROSCOE
                         I got something, Garth!

               Roscoe rushes forward and gives Fedora the box. Fedora steps 
               toward a lantern resting on a rock.

                                     ROSCOE
                         I got something... I got something 
                         right here.

               More whoops from the other men.

               Fedora puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. Halfbreed 
               pushes Roscoe as he jumps with excitement. Rough Rider steps 
               forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it.

                                     ROSCOE
                              (more whoops; then)
                         Oh, look at that!
                              (more whoops)
                         We're rich! We're rich!

                                     HALFBREED
                         Shut up. Shut up.

               Fedora takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it 
               aloft. Fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight 
               of it.

                                     ROSCOE (O.S.)
                         Well, we're rich, ain't we?!

               Indy takes off his hat and looks down at the off screen 
               action.

                                     HERMAN
                         Indy? Indy? What are they doing? 
                         Indiana? Indiana?

                                     INDY
                         Shhh!

               Fedora blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, 
               silently appraising its beauty... and its value. He seems 
               aloof from the others; somehow superior to them.

                                     HALFBREED
                         Hey, we got to find more stuff to 
                         bring back.

               Indy stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.

                                     INDY
                              (hushed; urgent)
                         It's the Cross of Coronado! Cortes 
                         gave it to him in 1521.

               Fedora continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the 
               rock next to its box and the lantern.

               Indy turns back to observe the men.

                                     INDY
                         That Cross is an important artifact. 
                         It belongs in a museum.

               A look of resolve comes into Indy's expression, and he turns 
               back toward Herman

                                     INDY
                         Run back and find the others. Tell 
                         Mister Havelock that there are men 
                         looting in the caves.

               Herman doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in 
               wide-eyed horror as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.

                                     INDY
                         Have him bring the sheriff.

               Indy matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. 
               Herman gasps.

                                     INDY
                         It's only a snake.

               Indy grabs Herman's scout scarf and pulls him closer.

                                     INDY
                         Did you hear what I said?

                                     HERMAN
                         Right. Run back. Mister Havelock. 
                         The Sheriff. What, what are you gonna 
                         do?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know... I'll think of 
                         something.

               Indy releases the scarf, gives Herman a pat and Herman dashes 
               off. Indy sees the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As 
               the Robbers continue to search for additional valuables, 
               Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of 
               the Cross...

               Fedora looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.

                                     FEDORA
                         Dig with your hands.

               Indy picks up the Cross.

                                     FEDORA (O.S.)
                         Not with your mouth.

               As Fedora stands watching the other men digging, Indy puts 
               the Cross in his pants and begins to pull himself up a rope 
               hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's feet break a wooden 
               beam, attracting the men's attention.

                                     ROSCOE
                         He's got our thing!

                                     HALFBREED
                         Get 'im!

               The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on Indy, 
               they almost knock each other over in the attempt.

               Only Fedora is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in 
               the direction of his fleeing companions -- then sets off 
               after Indy.

               EXT. THE CLIFFS - DAY

               Indy EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the 
               brightness of day.

               He pauses -- squints -- shields his eyes -- looks in all 
               directions.

                                     INDY
                         Mister Havelock! Anybody! Everybody's 
                         lost but me!

               He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. Rough 
               Rider, Halfbreed, and Roscoe are quick to appear and run 
               after him.

                                     FEDORA
                         There he is!

                                     MEN
                              (ad-libs)
                         Let's go! Let's get him! Let's go!

               Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES 
               are below. Indy puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES 
               for his horse, who trots over. Indy puts the Cross in his 
               belt.

               Indy PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he 
               JUMPS. But the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and 
               Indy lands flat on his feet in a standing position. The impact 
               sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his back teeth. 
               Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.

               Fedora AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see 
               Indy climb into the saddle and gallop off.

                                     INDY
                         Hyah! Hyah!

                                     ROSCOE
                         Hey! Come back here!

               Fedora puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and a 
               VINTAGE TRUCK AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind 
               the Pueblo (driven by two more gang members). Now we 
               glimpse...

               THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT

               The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's 
               wide brim. His arm is out the window, however, and we see an 
               olive-colored hand protruding from the sleeve of an expensive 
               white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in the 
               truck.

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         Come on. Get him!

               Indy SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not 
               only keep pace with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on 
               it.

               Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. 
               Indy crouched low and leaning forward in the saddle, his 
               heart pounding, his adrenaline pumping.

               Indy VEERS OFF in a new direction -- toward a RAILROAD TRACK.

               EXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY

               The train is barreling down the track. Indy rides up beside 
               it. He glances over his shoulder and sees the car and truck 
               gaining on him. No other choice... he LEAPS FROM HORSE TO 
               TRAIN.

               He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as Halfbreed and Rough 
               Rider leap from the truck onto the train.

               Halfbreed tries to grab Indy, but Indy leaps onto another 
               boxcar. Halfbreed runs after him but Indy leaps from the 
               boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar.

               Indy loses his balance but regains it. With Halfbreed and 
               Rough Rider still running after him, Indy enters the trap 
               door of...

               INT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

               and finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the 
               car's ceiling. Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing 
               all manner of reptiles: Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, 
               etc.

               Then, Halfbreed ENTERS through the trap door -- followed by 
               Rough Rider. Halfbreed grabs hold of Indy's feet, but Indy 
               kicks at him and he loses his grasp.

               Indy crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. 
               Halfbreed grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we 
               SEE large bins of squirming snakes.

               The combined weight of the three people is more than the 
               catwalk was intended for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM 
               THE CEILING.

               Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. 
               Too late. SEVERAL BOLTS TEAR FREE. Halfbreed and Rough Rider 
               SCREAM... but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that DROPS 
               DOWN... PLUNGING Indy to the floor of the car.

               He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he 
               finds himself eye-to-eye with an --

               ENORMOUS ANACONDA

               The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a 
               Tyrannosaurus Rex.

                                     INDY
                         Oh...

               Indy jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into 
               the SNAKE VAT.

                                     INDY
                         Oh... Oh...

               Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. Indy sinks into them. 
               They cover him. Engulf him. Almost smother him.

               Indy jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.

               Indy locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and 
               uses it to escape.

               Halfbreed, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the 
               car. He groans. Rough Rider moves to assist him.

                         Here, let me.

               EXT. THE TRAIN - DAY

               Indy stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. 
               Suddenly he looks worried as he frantically reaches into his 
               shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM IT and tosses it away.

               Roscoe APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab Indy. 
               Indy kicks at him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile 
               car as Indy moves on to...

               EXT. A FLATCAR - DAY

               Indy climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. Roscoe 
               follows, grabbing a long stick with a hook on it. He reaches 
               forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino 
               boxcar.

               INT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

               As a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's 
               fall, hitting a HUGE BLACK RHINOCEROS.
