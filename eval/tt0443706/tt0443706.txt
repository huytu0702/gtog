Our camera is MOUNTED to a CAR WINDOW. Driving through a
small town at night. Passing white picket fences. Kids'
discarded big wheels. American flags flutter.
July 4th, 1969 - Summer of Love. Vallejo, California
FIREWORKS streak into the sky. Cookouts winding down. The
car slows. Stops in front of a house on Beechwood Avenue.
The driver HONKS. MIKE MAGEAU races out. Skinny at 19.
Runs up to the window. To the camera:

eaten in like twenty four hours.
MIKE
Let me drive, then.
DARLENE
No way, Jose. I have to pick up
fireworks for the party tonight.
Food first though.
Mike doesn't move - he wants to drive.

BOOM DOWN to see a local Vallejo teen hangout. Although the
60's are almost over, Vallejo didn't get the memo. Darlene

She sees something offscreen. Frowning, unnerved:

Screw this place.

She touches his chest, playfully.
DARLENE
It's July and how many shirts are
you wearing?
MIKE

I'm cold.
DARLENE
You're cold in July?
BANG-BANG-BANG! Mike and Darlene JUMP and Mike gives out a
scream! Looking around to see KIDS. A group of them in
three cars. Laughing, they toss another lit string of
fireworks towards the Corvair. BANG-BANG-BANG!

eight feet behind them on their left side. Turning out the
lights. But not the engine. Mike stares at the car. Only
one person in it. Odd for a make out spot.

Darlene doesn't respond.

Mike, reaching over to start the engine when - A SPOTLIGHT

The door opens and THE COP inside gets out. Walks up to the

window)

Mike's BLOOD AND TEETH EXPLODE onto the dashboard.

The muzzle of a SILENCER FLASHES. The Man KEEPS SHOOTING.
BULLETS PUNCH through flesh and bone. Some shots rip straight
through Mike and into Darlene.
Mike is shot in the face, the neck, and the arm. Darlene is
shot twice in each arm, and three times in the back.
The Man lowers the gun.

Silence.

The Man turns away. Walking back to his car. A GROAN. The
Man turns. Walks back to the Corvair, reloading. Mike.
Still alive.
The Man FIRES TWO MORE SHOTS into Mike, propelling him into
the BACK SEAT. Then TWO MORE into Darlene for good measure.
The Man turns and walks away.

than killing wild game in the
forest because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill.
Something gives me the most
thrilling experience, it is even
better than getting your rocks off
with a girl. The best part of it
is that when I die I will be
reborn in paradise and they - They
I have killed will become my
slaves. I will not give you my
name because you will try to slow
down or stop my collecting of
slaves for the afterlife.

THEIRIOT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
The police shall never catch
me because I have been too
clever for them. One - I
look like the description
passed out only when I do my
thing, the rest of the time I
look entirely different. I
shall not tell you what my
disguise consists of when I
kill. Two - as of yet I have
left no fingerprints behind
contrary to what the police
say about me, I wear
transparent finger tips. All
it is is two coats of

ARMSTRONG (CONT'D)
An informant notified us that you
made certain statements eleven
months prior to the first Zodiac
murder and if they're true,
they're quite incriminating. Do
you recall having any such
conversation?
LEIGH ALLEN
No.
MULANAX
Have you ever read or heard about
the Zodiac?

Allen, surprised the second cop has joined in.
LEIGH ALLEN
When it was first in the papers,
sure. I didn't follow up after
those first reports.
ARMSTRONG
Why not?
LEIGH ALLEN
Because it was too morbid. I told
all this to the other officer.
Now it's the detectives turn to be thrown.

No. But it was right after the
murder at the Lake.
MULANAX
And what did you tell this officer?
LEIGH ALLEN
I told him that I'd gone to Salt
Point that weekend to skin dive.
I was alone but I met a couple
there. I have their names at home
if you want them.
MULANAX
That would be great, Arthur.
LEIGH ALLEN
Leigh.
MULANAX
What?
LEIGH ALLEN
Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.
Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me. It was about
four. I forgot to tell the
officer about that.
ARMSTRONG
What's your neighbor's name?
LEIGH ALLEN
Bill White. But he died about a
week afterwards. Heart attack.
So I never called to follow up.

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
...has confirmed that columnist
Jimmy Breslin of the New York
Daily News has received a letter
penned by the Son of Sam. Dubbed
the .44 Caliber Killer by the
press and later “Son of Sam” by
himself, the killer began his
rampage in 1976, targeting couples
in parked cars, and communicating
with authorities through a series
of handwritten letters.
Interest piqued, Graysmith heads to the LIVING ROOM. More
feminine now that a wife lives here. It's late, everyone
else asleep.
NEWSCASTER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
If any of this sounds familiar to
our viewers, it’s because our own
fair city once had a very similar
brush with the macabre. In light

police call "A Cold Case",
possibly the most famous in
history - The Zodiac.

died over the weekend when he was

GRAYSMITH
No?
MORRILL
Zodiac uses a mixture of cursive
and printing. Most of us do. We
choose at some point in our lives,
how to physically construct each
letter. Once we lock this into
our brains, our handwriting may
change over the years, but the
moves themselves will remain

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
Good evening. Our top story
tonight, the San Francisco Police
Department has confirmed that the
man who called himself Zodiac and
terrorized the Bay Area has broken
his silence of fifty one months.
In a letter claiming “I am back
with you” the Zodiac makes no
overt threats against the
citizenry, and muses that his life
and times would make the basis for
a good movie. The terse sixty-six
word missive also manages to
mention both San Francisco
Chronicle Columnist Herb Caen and
the Department’s own Inspector
David Toschi by name. Are they
targets? Or is something more at
work here? Our team coverage on
the Cipher Slayer’s Return begins
as Alan Freeman has more...

Melanie staring at him. He tries to be good. The kids,

...Thank you, Eric. These
personal mentions have drawn
controversial accusations from at

got fingerprints all over this."

one in Stine's cab.

So it's not him.

Graysmith really doesn't want to be here. Vaughn leads him
down the stairs, hand on his back as they walk.

one handbound volume from it and begins flipping through the
pages. Graysmith looks around, nervous.
The bulb above them flickers. Vaughn reaches up and tweaks
it with a finger - the light goes constant again. Above
Graysmith's head, the CEILING BOARDS CREAK. As though
someone were WALKING AROUND UPSTAIRS.

why Graysmith's there. He frowns. His face transforms. And
we see how terrifying this man really could be. They hold
each other's gaze for what seems like forever...
And Allen finally looks away. Graysmith blinks. Once.
Getting what he came here for. Knowing for sure. Graysmith
turns and walks out of the store.

July 4th, 1989 - Vallejo, California. AN AMERICAN FLAG
fluttering in the breeze. Twilight. The sun, giving way to
a crisp summer evening. The PARKING LOT where Darlene Ferrin
died. Twenty years later. Graysmith sits on the hood of his
car, sipping a Diet Coke. Older and grayer.

BAWART (O.S.)
Twenty years, huh? Darlene and
Mike - right there.
Graysmith looks up to see GEORGE BAWART ambling towards him.
Pointing at the spot the Corvair parked.
BAWART (CONT'D)
Kind of amazing, a guy shoots a
couple of farm kids, writes some
letters, and we’re still talking
about it. Robert Graysmith, I
presume.
GRAYSMITH
Sergeant Bawart?
BAWART
Call me George. I took over for
Jack Mulanax a couple years back.
GRAYSMITH
How’d you know it was me?
Bawart holds up a copy of the book.
BAWART
Your cover photo.
(looking around)
So Mike Mageau never made a
positive ID on anyone, huh?
GRAYSMITH
I could never find him.
BAWART
You talk to his family?
Graysmith looks at him.

Defensive.

GRAYSMITH
Why’d you ask me here, Sergeant?

Wanted to tell you something.
Couldn’t do it over the phone.

We've reopened the case on Arthur
Leigh Allen.

On Graysmith.

His vindication.
GRAYSMITH
Really?
BAWART
Really.

It’s your book that did it.

I never meant for it- I mean, I
got some of it wrongBAWART
You got a lot of it right, too.

book)
I don’t know how a civilian found
out half this stuff - hell, as a
cop I probably don’t want to know,
but things are moving again. We
found Robert Emmet the hippie.
(off Graysmith’s
look)
Yup, Robert Emmet Rodifer, went to
high school with Leigh, he's over
in Germany. We're also onto a guy
named Spinelli - claims Allen told
him he was gonna go to San
Francisco and shoot a cabbie.

Seriously?
Seriously.

He takes a step closer to Graysmith.

Confidentially:

BAWART (CONT'D)
Allen’s sick. He's got diabetes,
maybe terminal. So even if we get
him - he's already got. You
understand?
GRAYSMITH
But you have to do it anyway,
right?
BAWART
Hell, no one else will. Any case,
I thought you deserved to know.
GRAYSMITH
I appreciate it. Good luck.
He offers a hand and Bawart shakes it.
BAWART
Hey, you wanna go grab a bite,
talk the case a bit?
Tempting - the old Graysmith would have said yes in a
heartbeat. But he smiles as he realizes his answer is
Not really.

GRAYSMITH
But thanks.

BAWART
Mr. Graysmith, thank you.
Graysmith smiles.

BAWART
Mr. Mageau, thank you for seeing
me.
MIKE
You’re the one I talked to on the
phone?
BAWART
Yes, sir, George Bawart, Vallejo
PD, I took over the case from Jack

BAWART
This is just a formality. I'm
going to show you a group of
photographs. The person that shot
you may or may not be among this
group of photographs. You don't
have to pick anybody out just
because I'm showing you these
pictures. Do you understand?
MIKE
Yes, sir, I do.

Bawart picks up the envelope and extracts a PHOTO ARRAY from
it. LEIGH ALLEN'S FACE among five others. He places the
photo array down on the table.
Mike frowns, staring down at the different pictures...
BAWART
Take your time. If you don't
recognize anyone that's okay.
Mike stares at the pictures for 15 seconds.

LEIGH ALLEN. Bawart blinks.

A YOUNG ARTHUR

BAWART
How sure are you?
MIKE
Pretty sure. He had a round face
like this guy.
He points to the picture of a SECOND MAN.
BAWART
Are you identifying this second
person as well?
MIKE
No, no, just that he has a round
face like that. It's this man.
He taps the photo of Allen.
BAWART
On a scale of one to ten, how sure
are you?
MIKE
It's at least an eight. Only
other time I saw this face was on
July 4, 1969. I'm very sure
that's the man who shot me.

The following words appear:

In 1991 Arthur Leigh Allen's basement was searched by the
Vallejo Police Department. In it were found bomb diagrams,
explosive devices, 7 handguns, 4 rifles, and codebooks.
In order to secure the warrant, Don Cheney, the man who first
implicated Allen as the Zodiac, was given a polygraph test.
He passed with flying colors.

Following Mike Mageau's identification of Allen as the Zodiac
Police were scheduled to meet on August 27, 1992 to discuss
arresting him for the murders.
Allen suffered a fatal heart attack one day before this
meeting took place. No arrest was ever made.

These words fade.

Replaced by:

Inspector David Toschi retired from the San Francisco Police
Department in 1989. He was completely cleared of all charges
that he wrote the 1978 Zodiac letter.
Politically destroyed by the allegation, however, he never
rose above the rank of Inspector.

These words fade.

Replaced by:

In 2001 DNA tests were run on several of the Zodiac
envelopes. The San Francisco lab claimed DNA found under the
stamps did not match Arthur Leigh Allen's.
Some believe these tests exonerated Arthur Leigh Allen.
Others believe Zodiac would not have licked his own stamps
since saliva typing tests were already common in 1969.
In 2004, the San Francisco Police Department officially
deactivated the Zodiac investigation. The Zodiac cases in
Vallejo, Napa, and Solano County remain open to this day.

These words fade.

Replaced by:

Today Robert Graysmith lives in San Francisco and enjoys a
healthy relationship with his children. Many people believe
he was wrong in his conclusions on the Zodiac case.
The anonymous phone calls he was receiving abruptly ceased in
1992. Not a single one has occurred since Allen's death.
