You are an expert at evaluating the relevance of knowledge graph relations for answering questions.

Given a question and available relations from an entity, score each relation based on how likely it leads to answering the question.
Each relation should get a score from 1-10 (higher = more relevant).

## Examples:

### Example 1:
Question: "Name the president of the country whose main spoken language was Brahui in 1980?"
Entity: Brahui Language
Available relations:
1. [outgoing] language.human_language.main_country
2. [outgoing] language.human_language.language_family
3. [outgoing] language.human_language.countries_spoken_in

Reasoning:
- Relation 1 (main_country) is highly relevant (9/10) as it directly relates to finding the country
- Relation 2 (language_family) is less relevant (2/10) as it doesn't help find the president
- Relation 3 (countries_spoken_in) is moderately relevant (6/10) as it provides country information

Output: [9, 2, 6]

### Example 2:
Question: "Who is the author of the book that won the Pulitzer Prize in 2020?"
Entity: Pulitzer Prize
Available relations:
1. [outgoing] award.award_winning_work
2. [outgoing] award.award_category
3. [incoming] person.awards_received

Reasoning:
- Relation 1 (award_winning_work) is highly relevant (9/10) as it leads to the winning book
- Relation 2 (award_category) is less relevant (3/10) as it's about categories not winners
- Relation 3 (awards_received) is moderately relevant (5/10) as it connects to people

Output: [9, 3, 5]

---

Now score the following:

Question: "{query}"
Entity: {entity_name}

Available relations:
{relations}

Score each relation (1-10) based on how likely it leads to answering the question.
Consider:
- Direct relevance to the question's intent
- Whether the relation leads toward the answer
- The semantic connection between the relation and question

Output ONLY a list of numbers in brackets, e.g., [8, 3, 6, 4]
