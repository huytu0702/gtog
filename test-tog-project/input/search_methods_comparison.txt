# GraphRAG Search Methods Comparison

This document provides an overview of different search methods available in GraphRAG, focusing on their unique characteristics and use cases.

## Global Search

Global search is designed for high-level questions that require understanding the entire dataset. It operates by:

- Using community-level analysis to identify main themes
- Aggregating information across all documents
- Providing comprehensive summaries of the entire knowledge graph

Best use cases:
- "What are the main topics in this dataset?"
- "Give me an overview of the key themes"
- "What are the major trends across all documents?"

## Local Search

Local search focuses on specific entities and their immediate context. It:

- Retrieves entities directly related to the query
- Explores the neighborhood around target entities
- Provides detailed, factual information about specific topics

Best use cases:
- "What do we know about [specific entity]?"
- "Tell me about [person/organization]"
- "What are the details of [concept]?"

## DRIFT Search

DRIFT (Dynamic Reasoning and Investigation for Finding Truth) search combines local and global approaches:

- Starts with local entity exploration
- Dynamically expands to include community context
- Adapts the search strategy based on findings
- Provides progressive refinement of results

Best use cases:
- "How are [entity A] and [entity B] connected?"
- "What is the relationship between different concepts?"
- "Trace the connections between multiple entities"

## ToG (Think-on-Graph) Search

ToG search implements deep reasoning through iterative graph traversal:

- Performs multi-hop exploration using beam search
- Uses LLM-guided pruning to focus on relevant paths
- Maintains exploration history for explainability
- Generates evidence-based answers with reasoning chains

Key features:
- **Exploration Stage**: Iteratively expands through the knowledge graph
- **Reasoning Stage**: Synthesizes information from explored paths
- **Pruning Strategies**: LLM-based, BM25, or semantic similarity
- **Configurable Depth**: Controls exploration depth and width

Best use cases:
- "How does A influence B through intermediary factors?"
- "What are the paths from entity X to concept Y?"
- "Analyze the complex relationships between multiple entities"
- "What are the causal chains in this dataset?"

## Method Selection Guide

| Question Type | Recommended Method | Reason |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Dataset overview | Global | Broad coverage across all data |
| Specific entity details | Local | Focused, factual information |
| Entity relationships | DRIFT | Adaptive exploration of connections |
| Complex reasoning | ToG | Multi-hop analysis with evidence |
| Simple lookup | Basic | Fast, direct retrieval |

## Performance Considerations

- **Speed**: Basic < Local < Global < DRIFT < ToG
- **Detail Level**: Basic < Local < Global < DRIFT < ToG
- **Resource Usage**: ToG requires more API calls due to iterative exploration
- **Accuracy**: All methods provide accurate results, but ToG offers better explainability for complex queries

## Configuration Tips

For ToG search optimization:
- Start with `width: 3, depth: 3` for balanced performance
- Use `gpt-4o-mini` for cost-effective exploration
- Set `temperature_exploration: 0.4` for balanced creativity
- Set `temperature_reasoning: 0.0` for factual answers

This comparison helps users choose the appropriate search method based on their specific query requirements and performance constraints.
