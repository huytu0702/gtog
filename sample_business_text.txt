Apple Inc. announced its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday, showing better-than-expected results. The tech giant reported revenue of $89.5 billion, exceeding Wall Street's expectations of $88.2 billion. 

CEO Tim Cook said during the earnings call that iPhone sales remained strong despite supply chain challenges. "We're pleased with our performance this quarter," Cook told investors. "The iPhone 14 lineup has been particularly successful in emerging markets."

The company's services division, led by Senior Vice President Eddy Cue, continued its growth trajectory with $19.6 billion in revenue. This division includes App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud services.

Apple's stock price surged 3.2% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Market analysts at Morgan Stanley, led by technology analyst Katy Huberty, raised their price target for Apple shares from $175 to $185.

The earnings beat competitors like Microsoft and Google, who also reported their quarterly results this week. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella highlighted growth in Azure cloud services, while Google CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized improvements in their advertising business.
