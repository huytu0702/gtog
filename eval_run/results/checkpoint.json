The provided knowledge graph explicitly identifies an entity named \"CROSS OF CORONADO\" with the description \"A historical artifact given to Coronado in 1521\". This directly links the artifact to Coronado. While the term \"golden crucifix\" is not explicitly used, the \"CROSS OF CORONADO\" is the only artifact mentioned that fits the description of a crucifix and is associated with the grave robbers (Fedora's gang) from whom Indy steals it. The relationships show that Indy steals the \"Cross of Coronado\" from Fedora's gang, and Fedora is also involved in this event. Therefore, the artifact in question, the \"Cross of Coronado,\" belonged to Coronado.", "context": "INDY\n(hushed; urgent)\nIt's the Cross of Coronado! Cortes gave it to him in 1521.
